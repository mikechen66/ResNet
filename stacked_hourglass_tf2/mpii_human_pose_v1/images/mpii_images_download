Please download the zipped images and then unzip the file into the directory of images. The file of annotantions is not used 
in the stacked_hourglass application.

Please use the qBittorrent in the global market and xunlei is used in China to speed up the download. Otherwise, it would be 
quite slow in consideration of the quite large size of the images file.
