resnet_weights_dlownload

It is quick to download the weight by the wget. It has the recursive download feature to 
download everything under the specified directory.

Weights for TF: 
$ wget –r https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0f9s5baq6mtnwum/resnet152_weights_tf.h5?dl=0
Weights for TH: 
$ wget –r https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/up7iq2far6w2gk1/resnet152_weights_th.h5?dl=0

$ wget –r https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/up7iq2far6w2gk1/resnet152_weights_th.h5?dl=0


Notes: 

Users can try to run the script to download the weights. But it usually generates the temination issue
becuase the function of get_file() has a big problem with dropbox.
